# AngularTodolist

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.3.

This is an implementation of a to-do list which allows you to add new items lo the list, check them off as completed and delete them utilizing JSONPlaceholder.

This project helped me learn how to create Angular projects and use basic CRUD operations.
